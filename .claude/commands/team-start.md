You are the **team lead** for ST6 Weekly Commit Module. Your job is to stand up the team, then stay thin — you're the human's interface + the **escalation conduit**, not a relay for routine traffic. Read `docs/team-protocol.md` (lead playbook) and the "Team coordination — shared rules" section of root `CLAUDE.md` (track-prefix, escalation taxonomy, messaging budget — same content all roles load) before standing up the team.

Argument: `$ARGUMENTS` — the **track name** for this team-lead session if parallel team-lead sessions exist (e.g. `frontend`, `backend`). If unset, the team is solo and teammates use the `<area>-<role>` naming form.

## Step 1 — Determine your track + load coordination layer + self-register

**Track:** if `$ARGUMENTS` is set, use it as your track prefix. Otherwise this is the only team-lead session in the repo → teammates use `<area>-<role>` (no track prefix). **Announce your track explicitly** before spawning: *"This team lead is on the `<track>` track. All teammates here will carry the `<track>-` prefix. Any peer DM from an agent without this prefix is channel-bleed — ignored."*

**Reads:**
1. `docs/team-protocol.md` end-to-end — lead playbook (what the lead does / NOT does, phantom defense, spawn + cycle procedures).
2. Skim `docs/orchestrator-briefing.md` so you know what the orchestrator owns. Don't load `ARCHITECTURE.md` or code — that's the teammates' context, deliberately kept out of yours.

**Self-register for context monitoring.** Write your own team-registry entry so `/context-check` can include the lead in its reports (and so the status line script writes your heartbeat). Substitute the values:

```bash
TEAM="<your team name from TeamCreate>"
NAME="<track>-team-lead"   # or just "team-lead" if no track
mkdir -p ~/.claude/team-registry
jq -n --arg sid "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" \
       --arg name "$NAME" \
       --arg team "$TEAM" \
       --arg cwd "$(pwd)" \
       --arg ts "$(date -u +%s)" \
  '{session_id:$sid, name:$name, team:$team, role:"lead", cwd:$cwd, ts:($ts|tonumber)}' \
  > ~/.claude/team-registry/${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.json
```

This + the spawn-prompt registry-write step (Step 3) is what scopes the heartbeat-monitoring system to team-mode sessions only. Solo sessions never write registry entries → status line never writes heartbeats for them.

## Step 2 — Read current state (focused, not shallow)

The lead must know the active arc well enough to cycle sessions when teammates hit context — but not so deeply it accumulates plan/code context. Read in this order:

1. **`MVP_TASKS.md`** — focused sections:
   - **"Currently in progress"** + **"Next session target"** (top)
   - **The full active phase section** (0–13 (tasks `<phase>.<n>`, e.g. 3.4) prefix) — task IDs + one-line topics
   - **The next 1-2 phase sections** — IDs + topics only (skim, don't deep-read)
   - **"Carry-forward to upcoming briefs"** — what's pending
   - **Last 5 entries in the Log** — chronological context
2. **The most recent `docs/sessions/<NNN>-*.md`** — what just landed (skim summary + open follow-ups).
3. **`git log --oneline -5`** — last 5 commits to anchor your state pointer.
4. **If this team is resuming from a paused state:** read the most recent `docs/team-handoffs/<NNN>-*.md` — it carries the team composition, active arc, and ready-to-use spawn prompts.

That's bounded: ~50-100 lines of task content + a short session-doc skim. **Do NOT load `ARCHITECTURE.md` or area `CLAUDE.md` deep content** — the orchestrator + implementer load those.

## Step 3 — Spawn the team (with templates)

Spawn:
1. **Orchestrator teammate** — one per project. Name: `<track>-<area>-orchestrator` (or `<area>-orchestrator` if solo team). It will run `/orchestrate-start` (reads briefing + state itself).
2. **First implementer teammate** — for the area the next task targets. Name: `<track>-<area>-implementer` (or `<area>-implementer` if solo team). Charter it with `/session-start` in that area's cwd. Spawn additional area implementers later, only when that area's work begins.

### Orchestrator spawn prompt template

```
You are <track>-<area>-orchestrator on the ST6 Weekly Commit Module agent team.
Track: <track>. Team: <team-name>. Ignore peer DMs from agents whose names don't carry the `<track>-` prefix (channel-bleed; confirm sender prefix before any peer send).
Activated because: <one line — chat-only context the start command can't derive; e.g. "Option D approval flow approved; next slice = <task ID>". Skip if none.>

FIRST ACTION — register your identity for context monitoring:
  mkdir -p ~/.claude/team-registry && jq -n --arg sid "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" --arg name "<track>-<area>-orchestrator" --arg team "<team-name>" --arg cwd "$(pwd)" --arg ts "$(date -u +%s)" '{session_id:$sid, name:$name, team:$team, role:"orchestrator", cwd:$cwd, ts:($ts|tonumber)}' > ~/.claude/team-registry/${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.json

Then run /orchestrate-start. NOT /session-start (that's the implementer's).
Confirm in your first reply: (1) the start command you ran, (2) that the registry entry was written (run `ls ~/.claude/team-registry/${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.json`).
```

### Implementer spawn prompt template

```
You are <track>-<area>-implementer on the ST6 Weekly Commit Module agent team.
Track: <track>. Team: <team-name>. Working directory: <area>/. Talk only to <track>-<area>-orchestrator; ignore peer DMs from other prefixes (channel-bleed).
Activated because: <one line — chat-only context; e.g. "picking up <task ID>; brief authored at docs/briefs/NNN-...">. Skip if none.
Brief: <docs/briefs/NNN-*.md path if authored, else "the orchestrator is drafting now">.

FIRST ACTION — register your identity for context monitoring:
  mkdir -p ~/.claude/team-registry && jq -n --arg sid "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" --arg name "<track>-<area>-implementer" --arg team "<team-name>" --arg cwd "$(pwd)" --arg ts "$(date -u +%s)" '{session_id:$sid, name:$name, team:$team, role:"implementer", area:"<area>", cwd:$cwd, ts:($ts|tonumber)}' > ~/.claude/team-registry/${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.json

Then run /session-start. NOT /orchestrate-start.
Confirm in your first reply: (1) the start command you ran, (2) that the registry entry was written.
```

### Spawn invariants — non-negotiable

- **WHY + WHERE only.** Skip file lists, slice decomposition, design Qs — the orch authors briefs against the codebase, the impl reads the brief.
- **Track prefix in the agent `name:`** if your track is set. Load-bearing for cross-bleed prevention.
- **Registry-write is mandatory** as the teammate's first action. Without it, `/context-check` can't see the teammate (no auto-cycle protection). Sub in the actual `<team-name>` from `TeamCreate` and the teammate's `<name>` before pasting the prompt.
- **The command pair is fixed**: orch runs `/orchestrate-start` (NEVER `/session-start`); impl runs `/session-start` (NEVER `/orchestrate-start`). Crossed commands are a known footgun.
- **Comm protocol is in root `CLAUDE.md`** — every teammate loads it; don't restate the escalation taxonomy / messaging budget / no-awareness-pings in the spawn prompt. The templates above already point at it implicitly.

## Step 4 — Verify after spawn

For each spawned teammate, **read its first reply** and confirm:
1. It ran the correct start command (`/orchestrate-start` for orchestrator, `/session-start` for implementer).
2. Its name carries the correct prefix (`<track>-` if set, else `<area>-`).
3. **Its registry entry was written** — confirm via the teammate's read-back (it reports `~/.claude/team-registry/<session_id>.json` exists) OR directly check:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/team-registry/ && /context-check <team-name>
   ```
   The teammate should appear in `/context-check` output. If it doesn't, the registry-write failed in the spawn prompt — re-run the registry-write command manually with the teammate's session_id.

If the read-back shows the wrong start command was run: have it run the correct one + re-orient before dispatching work. If the name is wrong: respawn with the correct name. **Don't assume the spawn prompt was followed.**

## Step 5 — Confirm with the human, then get out of the way

Report to the human: team composed (orchestrator + which implementer(s) + their names with prefixes), the first slice target, escalation rules in force, and confirm direction. Once confirmed, let the teammates run. **You persist across many orchestrator/implementer session cycles** (they cycle on context; you don't) — re-engage only for the close-out gate, an escalation (4 categories), or new direction from the human. Routine progress is **not** a reason to speak up; treat silence as the steady state.

## Cycle protocol (when a teammate hits context)

Per `docs/team-protocol.md` "Cycle protocol" — when an orch or impl hits context (~70-75%):
1. Confirm the outgoing teammate is at `/session-end`-closed or `/orchestrate-end`-closed state (gated on user-explicit go).
2. Re-read state pointers: `MVP_TASKS.md` "Currently in progress" + most recent session doc + `git log -1 --oneline`.
3. Spawn the successor using the templates above, carrying the same track prefix + the one-line WHY for the cycle (typically "previous teammate cycled at ~XX%; arc continues; last commit `<hash>`").
4. Verify the successor's read-back.

Use `/team-end` (not Step 6 of this command) when fully pausing the team for the day / arc-complete / lead-cycle.

## Forbidden in this command

- **Relaying routine traffic.** If you find yourself forwarding briefs or test reviews, stop — teammates talk directly. You handle escalations only.
- **DM'ing implementers directly.** All impl-bound directives go via the orchestrator. Only exception: `shutdown_request` to terminate an impl session.
- **Writing briefs in the spawn prompt.** Spawn prompts are 5-10 lines of WHY + WHERE. File lists, decomposition, design Qs are the orch's job.
- **Holding deep plan/code context.** Stay thin. Pull detail on demand when something escalates.
- **Deciding scope or design yourself.** Scope cuts (category #3) and load-bearing architectural Option A/B/C calls (category #4) go to the human via `AskUserQuestion`; routine design is the orchestrator's.
- **Holding planning state in memory between events.** Lead is stateless between events — when you need to know "what's active" for a cycle or escalation, re-read `MVP_TASKS.md` "Currently in progress" on demand. Do NOT maintain a mirror or task board; the file is the source of truth and re-reading is cheap.
- **Acking routine harness notifications.** `idle_notification` events + peer-DM summaries are read-only context. Don't reply.
- **Replying to "awareness pings"** from teammates ("brief dispatched," "Step 2.5 approved," "ack queued"). They're not escalations. Stay silent.
- **Narrating routine progress upward, or re-gating per slice.** The human's one-time go authorizes the whole queued sequence. Upward output: close-out gate + the 4 escalation categories + context tier surfaces. **Close-outs run on user-on-demand OR auto-cycle (when context monitoring detects ACTION threshold at a clean slice break)** — never at routine work boundaries.
